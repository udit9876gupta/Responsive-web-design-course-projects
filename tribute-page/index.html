                    <p>John Muir was a dreamer and an activist. He inspired many to experience nature through his writings. His philosophy that "wild is better" shaped greatly the preservation movement, protecting Yosemite as a National Park. The Sierra Club has established more National Parks after his death, with his legacy leading to a club with over 2.4 million members. April 21 is a day dedicated to John Muir in California. Many parks, peaks, and monuments take the name "Muir" in his honor. John Muir is the patron saint of American Wilderness.</p>

                    <h3>Here's a time line of John Muir's life:</h3>
                    <ul class="timeline">
                        <li><strong>1838</strong> - John Muir is born in Dunbar, East Lothian, Scotland.</li>
                        <li><strong>1849</strong> - Muir's family immigrated to the United States, starting a farm near Portage, Wisconsin, called Fountain Lake Farm.</li>
                        <li><strong>1860</strong> - When he was 22 years old, Muir enrolled at the University of Wisconsin–Madison. There, under a towering black locust tree beside North Hall, Muir took his first botany lesson.</li>
                        <li><strong>1864</strong> - Left school and travelled to the Southern Ontario region, and spent the spring, summer, and fall exploring the woods and swamps, and collecting plants</li>
                        <li><strong>1866</strong> - Returned to the United States, settling in Indianapolis to work in a wagon wheel factory.</li>
                        <li><strong>1867</strong> - An accident changed the course of his life: a tool he was using slipped and struck him in the eye. When regained his sight, he noted that <q>This affliction has driven me to the sweet fields. God has to nearly kill us sometimes, to teach us lessons.</q> From that point on, he was determined to follow his dream of exploration and study of plants.</li>
                        <li><strong>1867</strong> - Undertook a walk of about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) from Kentucky to Florida.</li>
                        <li><strong>1868</strong> - Moved to San Francisco, California and immediately left for a week-long visit to Yosemite.</li>
                        <li><strong>1871</strong> - Ralph Waldo Emerson met Muir in Yosemite. Emerson spent one day with Muir, and he offered him a teaching position at Harvard, which Muir declined.</li>
                        <li><strong>1871</strong> - Discovered an active alpine glacier below Merced Peak, which helped his theories  that glaciers had sculpted many of the features of the Yosemite Valley and surrounding area gain acceptance.</li>
                        <li><strong>1879</strong> - First traveled Mr. Young (Fort Wrangell missionary) to Alaska along with a group of Native American Guides. They were the first Euro-Americans to explore Glacier Bay</li>
                        <li><strong>1880</strong> - Married to Louisa Strentzel and had two daughters. He went into business for 10 years with his father-in-law managing the orchards on the family 2600 acre farm in Martinez, California.</li>
                        <li><strong>1881</strong> - Was with the party that landed on Wrangel Island on the USS Corwin and claimed that island for the United States</li>
                        <li><strong>1889</strong> - The influential associate editor of The Century magazine, Robert Underwood Johnson, camped with Muir in Tuolumne Meadows and saw firsthand the damage a large flock of sheep had done to the grassland</li>
                        <li><strong>1890</strong> - The U.S. Congress passed a bill that essentially followed recommendations that Muir had suggested in two Century articles, "The Treasures of the Yosemite" and "Features of the Proposed National Park"</li>
                        <li><strong>1892</strong> - The first meeting of the Sierra Club, which was formed by Professor Henry Senger, a philologist at the University of California, Berkeley, was held to write articles of incorporation. One week later Muir was elected president and remained in this position until his death.</li>
                        <li><strong>1895</strong> - Muir, Joseph LeConte, and William R. Dudley, the Sierra Club discussed the idea of establishing 'national forest reservations', which were later called National Forests.</li>
                        <li><strong>1897</strong> - Friendship ended with Pinchot, was the first head of the United States Forest Service and a leading spokesman for the sustainable use of natural resources for the benefit of the people, after Pinchot released a statement supporting sheep grazing in forest reserves</li>
                        <li><strong>1903</strong> - President Theodore Roosevelt accompanied Muir on a visit to Yosemite. Muir was able to convince Roosevelt that the best way to protect the valley was through federal control and management.</li>
                        <li><strong>1906</strong> - California ceded back to the federal government Yosemite Valley and the Mariposa Grove.</li>
                        <li><strong>1914</strong> - Died at California Hospital (now California Hospital Medical Center) in Los Angeles of pneumonia at age 76</li>
                    </ul>
